"A weapon so rare and powerful that it has achieved mythical status in the Sector, the Tachyon Lance uses core technology based on the principles of an experimental FTL communication system prototype, but with a twist. Instead of using the hyperdimensional properties of the tachyon particle for communication, n-brane manipulation and anti-plasma generators create a charged tachyon stream that travels in hyperspace. Minimum energy requirements are staggering and this amount of power can only be generated for a few seconds by the largest power capacitors, which are housed within the weapon system. \n"
"\n"
"Unlike the beams fired from normal beam weapons, the tachyon stream is not lensed or altered in any way - in fact once the initial tachyon marker is actuated the reaction takes on a life of its own, rapidly consuming the power stored in the capacitors and unleashing destruction. When normal space is exposed to such high levels of anti-plasma, a combined electromagnetic, gravitic and thermal cavitation effect shreds anything that stands in its way, while also severely damaging nearby electronics equipment."

"\n"
"The design of the Gemini-class freighter is highly modular, enabling the ship to serve in a variety of roles in and out of combat. The entire cargo container is designed around a quick release mechanism which enables the main hull of the ship to quickly call to port, detach its full cargo section, and swap it for another Gemini-type container in the span of minutes. In addition, multiple medium weapon mounts make the Gemini a viable long-range fire support platform. The flight deck is tiny, originally envisioned for mining drone repair or hazardous mining operations. Modern use in the Sector extends flight deck facilities to all fighter types.\n"
"\n"
"While impressive in a blueprint, the lack of empty, compatible Gemini-type containers in the Sector makes the actual usefulness of the quick-release mechanism negligible. The modularity, a great boon in times past, is also more prone to wear and tear, and is thus more expensive to maintain - most working examples of the mechanisms have been welded solid. Nonetheless, a decent overall profile, the flight deck, a flexible power core and good shields make the Gemini a good choice for cargo hauling, if the cost can be weathered."

The Astral-class is very vulnerable should the X-35 come down. This is why when not protected by its fighter wings it never travels alone, but instead is at the head of space-borne carrier fleets.

Operators quickly anointed the MGA-220 model with the name \"Mudskipper\" and the name. This tough little ship has been a mainstay in backwater civilian transport for centuries, and although not pretty, the rugged construction simplifies maintenance and generous bay doors allow for great versatility. To this point, the Mudskipper's image in the public mind was cemented by a somewhat unlikely holovid sequence featuring a Mudskipper transporting a herd of bovids to a picturesque arid-terraform."

"Civilian hierarchies exist to govern the planets and stations under Hegemony rule but are entirely subordinate to the military. The specifics of civilian organization varies between worlds, as was Domain policy. When in doubt, the Hegemony applies a modified Domain-era colonial charter to dictate political organization. This standard-charter civilian hierarchy is generally elected, however as per martial law valid candidates must be approved by the local military authority. Exceptional times require exceptional measures, yet still the Hegemony fosters the flickering flame of galactic democracy under the same principles that founded the Domain.\n"

It is the perfect accompaniment to the quick-moving and hard-hitting fleet of an admiral who knows when to take the initiative, hit quickly, and withdraw while enemy forces are still responding to the threat.\n"
"\n"
"Historically the Heron represented a movement in Domain Armada strategy from a heavy capital ship doctrine based on overwhelming firepower toward a focus on strike craft and support cruisers that enable sufficient firepower to be quickly focused on weak points, a strategic shift that would reverse itself as a natural reaction against tradition from each successive generation of Armada officers. This process was occurring once more in the cycles immediately preceding the fall of the gate system and, in something of a coup for the so-called “Cruiser School”, the forward-thinking Altair Exotech won the Heron design contract over the traditional manufacturer of heavy Armada warships, Orion Shipyards. \n"

"However the doctrinal shift embodied by the Heron was interrupted by the isolation of The Fall, and as such it is not often found in core Hegemony fleets (whose officers still cling to tradition).
